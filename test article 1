    The investigation of piezoelectric properties of materials in the thin layer form has become an important task because of the increased range of their applications as actuators and sensors. The sensor magnitude, is a direct function of the e31 piezoelectric constant. Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 thin films and the modified compositions have attracted great attention in recent years as promising for use in microelectromechanical systems. To determine this constant we use an unusual experimental method. A remanent piezoelectric constant of -4.7 C/m2 was obtained. The parameters as, coercive field, saturation field, curve of first polarization, and self polarization of the remanent piezoelectric hysteresis loop are presented for 1.6 ??m thick PZT thin film. We will associate also dielectric results. To show the possible integration of the piezoelectric films in microelectromechanical systems, we have deposited PZT thin film on a 100 ??m long, 20 ??m wide, 1 ??m thick silicon oxide beam to control the z actuation.
